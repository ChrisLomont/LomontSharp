TODO:
Things to add, fix, etc.

DONE1. Matrix and Vec cleanup:
DONE    same base class
DONE    same funcs in them
DONE    leverage base class
DONE    general, specialize to 2d,3d,4d
DONE    base things to Matrix class : LU, QR, Lin solver, etc.

DONE: 2. Fix cofactors
3. LU stuff needs Det != 0
DONE 4. mat,vec - remove row, col
DONE 5. mat, vec copy
6. mat, vec: 0,1 items can be modified?! Same as axes? return copies?
DONE 7. orient pts needs fixed

8. better mvvm libs: Set, Get ppty, observable base, base, etc. - maybe replace with Microsoft?


Not kept up to date - this list now old!

Separate DLLs Win and WPF

Win
    # RunDll
    * Process control and capture
    more external win32 calling stuff

WPF
    $ mvvm lib (See AllRGB for my code)
      $- viewmodel base
      $- notifiable base
      $- dispatcher
      $- relay command
      $ - property observer
      $ - mediator
    WPF tools
      - controls that are nice (AllRGB for image)
         - pan and zoom image
         - arcball based 3d
         - data bound items in control draggable viewable
      - converters

Unsorted
anthing utility?
parsers
anything used more than once :)
giflib?
profiler,
GPS code?
Units?
make simple 3d and bitmap renderer/viewer app for base of things later
any extension classes
Make simple MVVM WPF blog post
