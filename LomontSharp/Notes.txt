Things to gather from old, other code
* = done first release
# added

Groupings:

Base: stuff super common

Numerical:
    * 3d/lin alg, 
        TODO: check vecs/mats for same funcs: det, deconstruct, etc.
    quat, svd, more
    *clamp, wrap, fuzzy close, etc.
    *lerp, slerp
    * Random number generation
       Rand algos - uniform int, uniform double, fast int, fast double
    solvers (see my GPS code), marching squares (ConvexHullPuzzle), marching cubes
    FFT (anything on my pages!)

Geometry:
    point in poly
    seg intersects, ray to tri, etc
    # mesh
    # mesh tools
    polygon, tri, quad, etc
    geometry, intersection, etc.
    polyhedra
    AABB

Graphics:
    *Color RGB, HSL, more?
    *Color spaces
    Named colors
    tiny fonts,
    graphics algos (circle, line, ??)
    basic effects (Fire, plasma, hue cycle)
    SSIM


Stats:
    Distributions,
    # gather, tally, etc.
    # stats, 
    # history, 
    # histogram,

UI:
  - arcball
  - pan and zoom, 2d and 3d

WPF
    mvvm lib (See AllRGB for my code)
      - viewmodel base
      - notifiable base
      - dispatcher
      - relay command
    WPF tools
      - controls that are nice (AllRGB for image)
         - pan and zoom image
         - arcball based 3d
      - converters
      - logger - colored console, message control? in WPF?

Container:
    k-d tree, similar
    * Shufflebag
    * Fenwicktree
    tree, graph, directed multigraph? Hypergraph? algos?
    ring buffer
    # priority queue
    # stable priority queue

Algorithm:
    * DLX algo (needs testing)
    Resevoir sampling
    combinatorics: *shuffle, *permutations, etc.
    # string searching stuff
    * DDA
    Fibonacci pseudo rand
    # sort extensions
    # shuffle extension

Format (file, output)
    # WAV

    # hex dumper
    # ByteWriter
    PGN?

Information (TODO - move these around?)
    compression things?
    *crcs, 
    adler checksum? others?
    Constant overhead byte stuffing, other protocols
    error correcting code
    # Bit reader and writer
    # Binary reader/writer for items
    basic compressionm codecs?

Utility (misc utils, dont fit elsewhere)
