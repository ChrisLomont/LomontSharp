Design of a data collection library

Some examples
https://github.com/skratchdot/stats-collector

things tracked for series of numbers:
basic: count, min, max, mean, sum
next: powerSumRunning, product, standardDeviationRunning, varianceRunning
advanced: amean,count_even, count_odd, count_integer, count_float, count >0, =0, < 0, prime, gmean, hmean
  mean, median, midRange, range, standardDeviationStable, sum of 1/, varianceStable, 

https://github.com/seqan/seqan3  - bio sequences
https://github.com/datascopeanalytics/traces - traces - track events over time, can aggregate, view, nice

boost histogram - multidimensional histograms

Wants:
 - number series: whisker plots, so need fractional values
 - resevoir sampling?
 - histogram: bin, sorted, etc.
 - confusion matrix
 - tally
 - data gathers into grid, sparse grid, 
   - data can be any tuple of thigs?
   - aggregate over portions of grid?


- how to aggregate huge sets?
